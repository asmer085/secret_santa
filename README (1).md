# **[Secret Santa]**
 

## **📖 Overview**
The Secret Santa App is a web application designed to facilitate anonymous gift exchange among employees. It randomly pairs participants while ensuring fairness and uniqueness in the pair selection process. 🎄🎁

✨ Features

✔ Random Pairing – Employees are matched using a randomized algorithm.

✔ Fairness Rules – Self-pairing is prevented, and each employee is both a giver and a receiver.

✔ Unique Pairs – No duplicate pairings occur within a single run.

✔ Handling Odd Participants – If an employee remains unpaired due to constraints, they are highlighted in the report.

✔ Dynamic Generation – Each new draw produces a different pairing combination.

✔ User-Friendly Report – A clear and structured output lists all Secret Santa pairs.
